  The issue of sexualization has already been addressed by laila Ayala in the article  <a href = "https://www.thepythonpost.org/issue-4-february-1/a-womans-unnecessary-work  "> <i>A Womanâ€™s Unnecessary Work: On the Sexualization of Young Girls at CSH</i> </a>

 <p> However this is not an isolated incident, there are many experiences that parallel our own.</p>

   The objectification of women is engrained into our culture, the article <a href = "https://highschool.latimes.com/brentwood-school/opinion-the-hypersexualization-of-girls-and-women/ "> <i>Opinion: The hypersexualization of girls and women</i></a> shows the uncomfortable experiences of women doing things as simple as finding a halloween costume, compared to her male counterpart.



 <p> Here are some videos that i found impactful and support my agruement</p>
  <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBfU-6l8m78 "> 
    <i>celebrities, self-sexualization, and you by Khadija Mbowe</i></a>
    <p>We see women on screens and concerts exposed and on display, doesnt it seem unfair that female artists are broken down into sex objects?</p> 
    
 <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oW-U338Ljs "> <i>The Hypersexualization of Teens and Children in Hollywood</i>
 </a>
   <p> Even in our shows, actresses have to deal with harsher work environments and broken boundries</p>

<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eV7HgWw_Ds" > 
  <i>Students outraged over school dress code policy</i></a>
  <p>Most importantly, in out schools, you would think school would be the last place this would happen. However this is the first place children are exposed to gender roles and inequality. Whether that be haressment from boys or unfair dresscodes enforced by administrators </p>
