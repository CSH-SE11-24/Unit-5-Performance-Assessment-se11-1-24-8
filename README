My project is inspired my Laila Ayalas article in the CompSciHigh Python Post.
It inspired me because i and many other female students can relate to the maltreatment within our school and sociatal community. 

On the Initial Page, there is a game were readers interact with pictures to choose which item of clothing is school appropiate.
The intention behind this was to show the double standard girls face in school and work environments

On the second page, there is a link to Laila Ayalas article

On the last page, there are more examples of the femal perspective that i found impactful.
